    "There are different ways how we can interact with FSLeyes programatically:\n",
    "* We can open a Python shell in the FSLeyes GUI from `View` > `Python shell`\n",
    "* We can open FSLeyes from the command line and run a script at the same time: `fsleyes -r myscript.py`\n",
    "* for an interactive mode, one can also use a Jupyter Notebook `fsleyes --notebookFile my_notebook.ipynb`\n",

You might notice that you don't need to import the 'load' function, because the some useful packages are already impored when FSLeyes is launched. You might also notice that that the variable `FSLDIR` is acessible within FSLeyes, but only if it was defined within the terminal session, where we launched FSLeyes. "
