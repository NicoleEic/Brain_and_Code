title: "Notes from a Brainhack: Automatization of sulcal labeling"
---

A few weeks ago, I had the chance to join the [Oxbridge Brainhack](https://oxbridgebrainhack.github.io), where I hosted a project to learn about algorithms that can be used for automatized labeling of sulci and gyri in the human cortex. So, I could have written a blog post about this, but it felt like re-writing the report, which can be found on the project's GitHub page. This is why I'm only posting a link here, where you find a collection of our thoughts: [>>LINK TO Brainhack_Oxbridge HERE<<](https://github.com/NicoleEic/Brainhack_Oxbridge)
