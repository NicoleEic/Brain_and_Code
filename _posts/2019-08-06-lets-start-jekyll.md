I found some useful info to get started with Jekyll at the following link:

```
https://onextrapixel.com/start-jekyll-blog-github-pages-free/
```

The Quick-start instructions are the following:
```
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```
