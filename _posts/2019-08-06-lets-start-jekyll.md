title: "Let's start to use Jekyll"
---

Ok... you might have figured out that this post was actually created automatically when I first initialized the repository. But in the end I would like to keep it to remind myself and you how to use Jekyll as a site generator and GitHub Pages to host the page.

I found some useful info to get started with Jekyll at the following links:
```
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
https://talk.jekyllrb.com/
https://onextrapixel.com/start-jekyll-blog-github-pages-free/
```

For a Quick-start type the following in your computer terminal:
```
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new Brain_and_Code
cd Brain_and_Code
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The site is generated locally and you can access it in your browser by navigating to:
```
http://localhost:4000
