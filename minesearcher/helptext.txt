Welcome to Minesweeper!

The aim of the game is to find all safe squares in the grid. You uncover a field by left clicking on it. 

If you click on a square that hides a mine, the game ends and you lose. When you uncover a safe square, a number appears that tells you how many mines are hidden in the neighboring squares. This information helps you to make the next guess for a safe square. 

If you assume a square to be mined, you can mark it with a flag by right-clicking. This disables clicking on the square by accident. 

If you open a square that contains 0 neighboring mines, all neighboring squares will be opened automatically.

The counter in the upper-left corner tells you how many mines are still hidden.

A timer in the upper-right corner is counting the seconds from the start of the game.

You can always restart the game by clicking on the smiley or by choosing 'New Game' in the menu.

There are 3 predefined levels with the following settings:
- Beginner: 8x8 board with 10 mines
